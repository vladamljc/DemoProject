# DemoProject
My first project

Project's purpose is to be used as online catalog. Project is divided into two parts. One part 
is for administration of the website and the other one is for visitor(user of the catalog).

Database constants:
DB_DRIVER - setting driver for database
DB_HOST   - setting where the site is hosted
DB_NAME   - setting how is the database called
DB_USER   - setting username for database access
DB_PASS   - setting password for database access
DB_PORT   - setting listening port for mysql

When setting database on local machine, set constant's values to your database settings.
